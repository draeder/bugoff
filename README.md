# Bugoff
A [Gun DB](https://github.com/amark/gun) extension that ships secure* ephemeral messaging between Gun peers using [Bugout](https://github.com/chr15m/bugout), secured by Gun's SEA suite

# About
Gun peers typically communicate messages with each other by listening for graph change events. That means those messages generally must be stored somewhere on the graph before a peer receives a message about it. Bugoff glues together Gun and Bugout (which is a decentralized messaging library based on WebRTC/WebTorrent) to provide ephemeral messaging between peers that does not need to -- but may -- be stored in a Gun DB graph.

Bugoff peers connect to each other through [Bugout](https://github.com/chr15m/bugout), which is a WebTorrent extension that swarms peers together based on an infohash shared to the WebTorrent network. Since the infohash represents the room name which is displayed as clear text in the torrent, Bugoff abstracts that away with a SHA256 hash of the room name. This way only those who know the room name and/or its SHA256 hash can join it.

Bugoff creates an SEA encryption pair for every Bugout connection, encrypts each message with a shared secret, then decrypts the message once received by the recipient peer(s).

## *Status
Bugoff is in an experimental state. Some intended features and functionality are not working correctly yet and has not been audited:

- Bugoff should work in the browser with Browserify, but has not yet been tested.
- Ability to pass in and use Gun SEA pairs. This may work if you experiment with it, but it is not built in yet.
- Gun method chaining has not yet been tested, although this is a Gun chain extension.
- Implement/improve swarm-wide encryption. Although broadcast message encryption is present, it is based on an SEA pair all peers share.
- A bug exists with broadcast message decryption logging `Could not decrypt` to the console, despite decryption occurring successfully.

### Example
```js
const Gun = require('gun')
require('./index.js')

let gun = new Gun()

// opts is optional, for example, use your own WebTorrent tracker server:
// { announce: 'wss://yourtracker/' }
gun.bugoff('some room identifier', opts)

// Log your Bugoff room/swarm identifier. This can be passed back in for other peers to join
console.log(gun.bugoff.id)

// Log your Bugoff/Bugout peer instance address
console.log('My address:', gun.bugoff.address())

gun.bugoff.on('seen', (address) => {
  // Log the new peer's address
  console.log('Seen!', address)
  
  // Broadcast a message to all peers
  gun.bugoff.send('Broadcast test message')

  // Send a message directly to another peer
  gun.bugoff.send(address, 'SEA Direct test message')
})

// Log decrypted messages
gun.bugoff.on('decrypted', (address, message) => {
  console.log('Decrypted!', message, 'From:', address)
})

// Log the encrypted messages (may be useful for debugging)
gun.bugoff.on('message', (address, message) => {
  console.log('Encrypted:', message, 'From:', address)
})
```
